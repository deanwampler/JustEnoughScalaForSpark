    "## Introduction: Why Scala?\n",
    "Spark lets you use Scala, Java, Python, R, and SQL to do your work. Scala and Java appeal to _data engineers_, who do the heavy lifting of building resilient and scalable infrastructures for _Big Data_. Python, R, and SQL appeal to _data scientists_, who build models for analyzing data, including machine learning, as well as explore data interactively, where SQL is very convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "These aren't hard boundaries. Many people do both roles. Many data engineers like Python and may use SQL and R. Many data scientists have decided to use Scala with Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, some of the advantages of using Scala include the following:\n",
    "* **Performance:** Since Spark is written in Scala, you get the best performance and the most complete API coverage when you use Scala. It's true that with [DataFrames](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html), code written in all five languages performs about the same. If you need to use the [RDD](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#resilient-distributed-datasets-rdds) API, then Scala provides the best performance, with Java a close second.\n",
    "* **Debugging:** When runtime problems occur, understanding the exception stack frames and other debug information is easiest if you know Scala. Unfortunately, the \"abstraction leaks\" when problems occur.\n",
    "* **Concise, Expressive Code:** Compared to Java, Scala code is much more concise and several features of Scala make your code even more concise. This elevates your productivity and makes it easier to imagine a design approach and then write it down without having to translate the idea to a less flexible API that reflects idiomatic language constraints. (You'll see this in action as we go.)\n",
    "* **Type Safety:** Compared to Python and R, Scala code benefits from _static typing_ with _type inference_. _Static typing_ means that the Scala parser finds more errors in your expressions at compile time, when they don't match expected types, rather than discovering the problem later at run time. However, _type inference_ means you don't have to add a lot of explicit type information to you code. In most cases, Scala will infer the correct types for you."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Why Not Scala?\n",
    "Scala isn't perfect. There are two disadvantages compared to Python and R:\n",
    "* **Libraries:** Python and R have a rich ecosystem of data analytics libraries. While the picture is improving for Scala, Python and R are still well ahead.\n",
    "* **Advanced Language Features:** Mastering advanced language features gives you a lot of power to exploit, but if you don't understand those features, they can get in your way when you're just trying to get work done. Scala has some sophisticated constructs, especially in its _type system_. Fortunately, Spark mostly hides the advanced constructs."

In this case, while we can't assign a new array to `immutableValue`, we can change elements within the array! Put another way, immutability isn't _transitive_."

    "The primitives types, `int`, `long`, etc. are not considered part of the type hierarchy and are treated specially. This is in part a performance optimization, as instances of these types fit in CPU registers and the values are pushed onto stack frames. However, they have wrapper or \"boxed\" types, `Integer`, `Long`, etc., that are part of the type hierarchy, which you must use with Java's collections, for example (with the exception of arrays).\n",

    "Instead, Scala treats the primitives at the code level as basically the same as the reference types. You don't use `new Int(100)` for example, but you can call methods on `Int` instances. The code generated, in most cases, uses the optimized JVM primitives. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the Scala type hierarchy defines a type [Any](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.Any) to be the a parent type of _both_ reference types and \"value\" types (for the primitives).

By defining `Null` to be the subtype of all reference types `AnyRefs` (but not `AnyVals`), it supports at the type level the (unfortunate) practice of using `null` for a reference value.\n",

It includes many words that you might not consider stop words. Nevertheless, I'll just use a smaller list here.\n",
